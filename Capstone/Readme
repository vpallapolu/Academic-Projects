This project focuses on analyzing the Drugs.com dataset to uncover relationships between drugs, side effects, and medical conditions using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. 
The workflow included data cleaning, Named Language Processing (NLP) using scispaCy to extract drug-related entities, and topic modeling using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to identify key themes from patient reviews. 
The project leveraged Python with libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and ScispaCy, alongside visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
Findings revealed meaningful patterns in drug-side effect associations and patient concerns, providing actionable insights that can support pharmacovigilance and enhance patient safety in healthcare.
Additionally, an interactive Streamlit-based web application was built to provide users with functionalities such as data exploration, visualization, and drug review insights, making the results accessible in real time.
