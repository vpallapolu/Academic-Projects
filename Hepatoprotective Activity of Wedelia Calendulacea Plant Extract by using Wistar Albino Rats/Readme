This study investigated the potential liver-protective effects of ethanolic extract from the leaves of Wedelia calendulacea. Acute toxicity tests confirmed the extract to be safe up to a dose of 2g/kg in albino rats. The hepatoprotective effect was assessed using a carbon tetrachloride (CClâ‚„)-induced liver damage model. Results showed that treatment with the extract led to a significant improvement in liver function markers, such as reduced SGPT and SGOT levels, increased total protein, and stabilized albumin levels, indicating that the extract effectively protected liver tissues. These findings suggest that Wedelia calendulacea leaf extract has promising hepatoprotective properties.
