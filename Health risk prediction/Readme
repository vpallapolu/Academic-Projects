The Health Risk Prediction App is an interactive, machine learning-based application designed to assess individual health risks using clinical and lifestyle data. 
Built with Python and deployed via Streamlit, the app leverages an XGBoost classification model to predict a user’s health risk level, categorized as Low, Moderate, or High, based on factors such as age, gender, physical activity, calorie intake, sleep patterns, heart rate, and medical conditions like diabetes or heart disease.
Using a curated dataset from Kaggle, the team performed comprehensive preprocessing and feature engineering, including the creation of a novel Health Risk Score to serve as the model’s target variable. 
This score integrates various health indicators into a single numeric value, making it easier to interpret and act upon. 
The model achieved an accuracy of 84%, with strong precision and recall metrics, indicating reliable performance in multi-class classification.
The app is intended for use by both individuals and healthcare professionals, especially those managing or at risk of chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. 
By providing personalized insights, it supports early intervention and promotes healthier lifestyle choices.
