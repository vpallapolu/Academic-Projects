This policy brief addresses significant oral health disparities affecting low-income populations in the United States, who experience untreated tooth decay at rates two to three times higher than affluent groups. 
These inequities are driven by limited adult Medicaid dental coverage, few dentists who accept public insurance, and high out-of-pocket costs. 
The lack of dental care exacerbates chronic conditions like heart disease and diabetes, affects mental health, and hinders employment opportunities.
While policies like CHIP cover children, adults are often left with only emergency dental benefits. 
To address this, the brief recommends making comprehensive dental care an essential benefit in public insurance programs like Medicaid and Medicare. 
Further recommendations include integrating oral and medical care services to make them more affordable and accessible. 
The brief also suggests supporting community-based clinics and licensing mid-level dental practitioners to serve low-income areas. 
These reforms aim to reduce health inequities and improve overall well-being for vulnerable populations.
