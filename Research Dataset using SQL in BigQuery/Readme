This project details the creation of a comprehensive research dataset to analyze factors influencing health insurance coverage in the U.S. 
It integrates seven public datasets covering key domains like demographics, poverty, income, unemployment, health status, and Medicaid/CHIP enrollment. 
Using SQL queries on the Google BigQuery platform, these sources were joined to build a single, structured dataset for analysis.
The final dataset is 21.2 GB and contains 34 columns with state and county-level information on population, poverty rates, and uninsured numbers by age and gender. 
It is designed for policy analysis and comparative research to evaluate healthcare initiatives and identify vulnerable populations.
The project concludes that socioeconomic status is a significant determinant of healthcare access. 
This new dataset provides a strong evidence-based foundation for policymakers to develop targeted interventions, reduce health inequities, and improve public health outcomes.
