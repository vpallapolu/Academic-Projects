This project focuses on predicting Type 2 Diabetes using machine learning algorithms applied to a clinical dataset containing patient attributes such as A1c levels, age, weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol metrics. 
The analysis involved feature selection based on correlation insights, followed by exploratory data analysis through visualizations like scatter plots, histograms, and boxplots. 
Multiple supervised learning models—including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with various kernels, and Random Forest—were implemented and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. 
The Random Forest classifier achieved the highest accuracy (99.12%) with excellent precision and recall, making it the most effective model for this dataset. 
The project demonstrates end-to-end data preprocessing, model training, performance comparison, and interpretation, offering insights into key predictors like A1c, age, and weight for diabetes risk.
