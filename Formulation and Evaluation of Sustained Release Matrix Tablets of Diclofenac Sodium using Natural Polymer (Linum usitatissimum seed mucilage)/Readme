This project explored how flaxseed mucilage, a natural, plant-based polymer can be used to create sustained release tablets for Diclofenac sodium, a common anti-inflammatory drug. The goal was to develop a tablet that releases the drug slowly over time to reduce side effects and improve patient compliance. By comparing flaxseed mucilage with standard polymers like HPMC and xanthan gum, the study found that flaxseed is a promising, natural alternative for controlled drug delivery.
