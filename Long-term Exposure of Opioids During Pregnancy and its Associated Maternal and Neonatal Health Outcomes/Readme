This research proposal aims to evaluate the adverse effects of long-term opioid exposure during pregnancy on maternal and neonatal health. 
It hypothesizes that prolonged opioid use leads to negative outcomes like maternal death, premature birth, and Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) in newborns. 
The study is designed as a five-year observational, longitudinal cohort study to track these long-term effects.
The study population will include pregnant individuals with documented opioid use and their infants, recruited from various clinics and medical registries. 
Key dependent variables are maternal death, premature birth, stillbirth, and the incidence of NAS in newborns. 
Data will be collected from medical records and interviews throughout the prenatal, delivery, and postpartum periods.
A major strength of this study is its longitudinal design, which allows for the assessment of long-term consequences. 
Ultimately, the findings will help inform clinical practices and public health policies to better support pregnant individuals with opioid use disorder.
