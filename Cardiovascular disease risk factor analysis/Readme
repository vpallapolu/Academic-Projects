This research project investigates the association between cardiovascular disease and five key risk factors: gender, age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes. 
Using a heart disease prediction dataset, the study employs Chi-square and t-tests to analyze each factor's significance. 
The results show a significant relationship between heart disease and gender, age, and blood pressure. 
Males exhibited a higher prevalence of heart disease, and the average age and blood pressure were significantly higher in individuals with the condition. 
Conversely, the study found no statistically significant link between heart disease and either cholesterol levels or high fasting blood sugar (diabetes). 
A final logistic regression model confirmed that age, sex, and blood pressure combined were the strongest predictors. 
The research underscores the importance of these three factors in risk assessment and creating targeted preventative strategies.
