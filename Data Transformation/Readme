This project demonstrates a comprehensive data transformation process on a US demographics dataset using Python and the Pandas library. 
The primary goal is to clean and organize the raw data, making it suitable for accurate analysis and modeling.
The procedure begins with loading the dataset and dropping unnecessary columns to streamline the information. 
Columns are then renamed for clarity, and data types are downcast (e.g., float64 to float32) to optimize memory usage from 466kb to 306kb. 
The transformation also includes checking for null values, removing duplicate entries, and cleaning whitespaces from text fields. 
Additionally, two age-related columns are merged into a single, more descriptive column.
A key step involves identifying and removing outliers from numerical columns like population size and poverty rate using the Z-score method. 
This cleaning reduces the dataset from 3141 to 3045 rows, resulting in a high-quality dataset ready for analysis.
