This project analyzes California hospital discharge and readmission data from 2018 to identify key healthcare utilization patterns. 
By integrating four public datasets, the study examines inpatient visits, discharges by diagnosis, county population, and 30-day readmission rates.
Key findings reveal that older adults (70-89) are the primary users of facility-based hospice, with neoplasms and respiratory diseases being common diagnoses. 
The analysis identifies Medicare patients as having the highest readmission rates. Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between a county's population and the demand for home-based hospice services. 
While discharges generally align with population size, some counties exhibit disproportionately high readmission rates.
Ultimately, the analysis pinpoints opportunities to reduce hospital readmissions by targeting specific demographics and supporting high-risk counties.
