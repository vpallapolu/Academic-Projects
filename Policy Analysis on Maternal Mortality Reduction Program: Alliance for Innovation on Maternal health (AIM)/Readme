This report analyzes the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM), a national program aimed at reducing maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity (SMM) in the U.S. Funded by HRSA, AIM implements evidence-based "maternal safety bundles," which are standardized protocols for critical issues like obstetric hemorrhage and sepsis. 
Since its launch in 2014, the program has expanded significantly, reaching 49 states and nearly 2,000 birthing facilities by 2023.
The program's success is measured through data-driven improvements, resulting in reduced SMM rates and improved maternal health metrics. 
While AIM successfully met its objectives, it faced challenges like inconsistent implementation across states and data collection lags. 
The primary beneficiaries include high-risk pregnant women, healthcare providers, and policymakers. 
Future directions focus on expanding the program into community settings through the AIM-CCI initiative and improving data collection to further address health disparities.
