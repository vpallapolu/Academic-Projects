This project details an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a US demographics dataset using Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib. 
The primary goal is to clean, visualize, and understand the data to identify patterns, trends, and outliers related to population characteristics across states and counties.
The process begins with loading the dataset and using descriptive functions like .info() and .describe() to explore its initial structure. 
Data cleaning involves dropping irrelevant columns and checking for null values, though the dataset was found to have no missing entries.
Various visualizations, including histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots, are created to analyze distributions and relationships. 
For example, histograms revealed that Nebraska has many counties with high poverty and low population. 
Boxplots helped identify outliers and understand the data spread for variables like age groups and racial demographics. 
This EDA successfully highlights key socioeconomic characteristics, preparing the dataset for more advanced analysis.
